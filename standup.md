What did I work on yesterday?
What am I working on today?
What is blocking me?
-Other team members should jump in to help resolve an individual's blockers

Walking the board: walk through every aspect of the project and go over who owns each piece. Look for any blockers. Start by talking about the items that are closest to completion.

Stand-ups are quick, daily meetings that keeps everyone on the team up to date on the status of the project. This meeting goes over the work that has been done, the work that needs to be done, and the blockers that are impeding the team's progress.

Keep the stand-ups on topic and efficient.
